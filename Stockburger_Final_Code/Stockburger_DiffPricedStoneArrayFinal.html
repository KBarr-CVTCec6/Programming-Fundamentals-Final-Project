<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT:
a. User selects either a necklace or ring to design. (Did not get this part to work.)

b. Then the user enters the birthday month or whomever they would like to add to the design.

  i. After the first month is entered, the system will continue to prompt asking
  if there are additional stones to add.

  ii. If the jewelry design is a ring, then there is a maximum of 6 stones that
  can be added to each ring before a second ring would be required.

  c. The month entered will equate to a stone that will be added to the necklace or
  ring (ring has max of 6 stones).

  d. Then a total will be calculated, and a description of the jewelry being purchased
  will be displayed at the end.



Nouns: Necklace, ring, ring = max of 6 stones, birthday month (12 months), order description, total

Verbs: Prompt, prompt again for more, substitue month for birthstone, calculate sum of order, display total and descriptions


</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <p>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram. Follow the course naming standards for inputs and outputs.</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS: 
ring
necklace
month
done



PROCESSING:
change count of months to price
stone price = calculate number of months * 25
add stone price to jewelry price



OUTPUTS:
display count of months entered
display total of price
display months entered
display thank you



</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Create a solution algorithm based on the defining diagram.</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">
SOLUTION ALGORITHM
input 
loop
birthday month
month (to calculate count)
total

while prompt for birthday month has a value = true
when user enters "done" = false
display count of months entered
display total of price of stones and jewelery together
display months entered
display thank you
