<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT:
a. User selects either a necklace or ring to design.

b. Then the user enters the birthday month for each child or for whomever you
would like to add to your design.

  i. After the first month is entered, the system will continue to prompt asking
  if there are additional stones to add.

  ii. If the jewelry design is a ring, then there is a maximum of 6 stones that
  can be added to each ring before a second ring would be required.

  c. The month entered will equate to a stone that will be added to the necklace or
  ring (ring has max of 6 stones).

  d. Then a total will be calculated, and a description of the jewelry being purchased
  will be displayed at the end.



Nouns: Necklace, ring, ring = max of 6 stones, birthday month (12 months), order description, total

Verbs: Prompt, prompt again for more, substitue month for birthstone, calculate sum of order, display total and descriptions


</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <p>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram. Follow the course naming standards for inputs and outputs.</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS: 
jewelery
month
done



PROCESSING:
change jewelery type 1 to necklace and 2 to ring
change month to stone
calculate price for necklace or ring
calculate price for stone
total price


OUTPUTS:
display jewery type
display list of stones



</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Create a solution algorithm based on the defining diagram.</p>
