Well, done. You might need to take the date and substring out the month to compare the month number to the number in the IF/ELSE statement. If you need a loop, just encapsulate the entire code with a WHILE statement that asks if you would like to calculate another birthstone or restaurant calculation. That is an easy way to add a repeating loop to your program.

//Variables
var jewelery;
var month;
var stone;


//Assignment from prompts
jewelery = prompt("Enter 1 to build a necklace or 2 to build a ring")
month = prompt("Enter a birthday month to add to your oder. Or enter done to finish.");

//Calculation
switch(month) {






}
